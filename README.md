 Detecting fraud in Credit card transactions using Isolation Forest & Local Outlier Factor
 
Findings-

Local Outlier Factor-
We have 99.65% accuracy but we were only accurate because there are a lot of valid cases than Fraudulent cases. but we are very bad in terms
of detetecting fraudulent cases (precission, recall, f1-score = 0.02)

Isolation forest-
However in this case We have achieved alomost 30% in detection of those outliers (precission, recall, f1-score = 0.28). which is not great
but a significant step in the right direction
